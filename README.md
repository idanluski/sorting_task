**Section: 0**
Exiting the program while giving a message to the user (found in the input and output files), it is also important to note that each number -
positive and up to two digits - the menu will accept (any number that is not such will repeatedly request input from the user), but any number
that was received and which is not one of the sections will be considered an error, 5 cumulative errors will end the program with an error message
suitable\

**Section 1**\
Entering words, enter the number of words that will be entered into the software, a valid number is between 2 and 10, any invalid number will ask
Input repeatedly, after entering a valid number N, the user will be prompted to enter N strings, each string must be a child
Maximum 20 characters (including the '0'), and contain only letters (z-a or Z-A), any other data will not be accepted. Presumably not
There will be an input of over 200 characters.\
**Section 2**\
will work only after section 1 has been run at least once - printing all existing strings in order, when before each
The serial number, the sum of the ascii codes and the average of the ascii codes of each string are detailed.\
**Section 3**\
will only work after section 1 has been run at least once - lexicographic string sorting, the sorting changes the previous order but
not printing\
**Section 4**\
Will work only after section 1 has been run at least once - sorting all existing strings according to their size in ascending order.\
**Section 5**\
will only work after section 1 has been run at least once - sorting all existing strings according to the sum of the ascii codes of
the string.
**Section 6**\
will only work after section 1 has been run at least once - sorting all existing strings according to the average of the ascii codes of
the string\
**Section 7**\
will only work after section 1 has been run at least once - sorting an existing string by itself so that every character in the string is
Less than or equal to the ascii value of the character to the right.
**Section 8**\
will only work after section 1 has been run at least once - sorting all strings as if they were one string and then returned
for the original strings according to their size, for example for the following existing strings:\

After this sorting, they will become the following strings (each one will remain the same size and position, but the characters are as if all the strings
There was one string in the sequence and it was sorted (:
